After preparing the list of rare LP/P/LGD variants with annotations from different tools (e.g., InterVar, Psi-Variant, etc.) and databases (SFARI, DOMINO, DisGeNET, ClinVar, etc.) as described in the data methods section, AutScore.r can be implemented by a dedicated R script AutScore.r_implementation.R. Here we transform the modules of AutScore (I, P, D, etc.) first and then fit a logit model and generate the prediction score, defined as AutScore.r. This takes around 2.178 seconds to process a list of 177 variants by the R Script AutScore.r_implementation.R. 
The recommended cut-off of AutScore.r in our dataset is 0.335, however, a user can easily change this cut-off as per the convenience using the R codes provided. More details about the input data and the R script can be found at: https://github.com/AppWick-hub/AutScore
