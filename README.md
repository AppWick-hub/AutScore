AutScore.r is a statistical model generated prediction score to prioritize the ASD candidate rare variants (SNVs and INDELS) based on the Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) data from simplex/multiplex ASD affected families from the Israeli population.
After preparing the list of rare LP/P/LGD variants with annotations from different tools (e.g., InterVar, Psi-Variant, etc.) and databases (SFARI, DOMINO, DisGeNET, ClinVar, etc.) as described elsewhere, AutScore.r can be implemented by a dedicated R script AutScore.r_implementation.R. Here we transform the modules of AutScore (I, P, D, etc.) first and then fit a logit model and generate the prediction score, defined as AutScore.r.
